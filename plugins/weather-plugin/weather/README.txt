A plugin that talks to the user about the current weather.

The main class edu.wpi.always.weather.wunderground.WundergroundParser downloads fresh data to a
time-stamped JSON file in always/user/weatherData folder.

TODO: WundergroundJSON needs to be changed so that it uses the ontology.

Use always/agent/bin/always-disco to run test cases in test folder.
