A plugin that talks to the user about the current weather.
The plugin pulls all of its data from wonderground.
After the weather data has been downloaded, it is compiled into a JSON format which is stored to a file in the user directory and then pushed into the disco instance.
The schema also pulls weather data for all people and places the the system knows about.
