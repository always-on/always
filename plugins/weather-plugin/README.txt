This folder contains the implementation of the plugin for discussing
the weather, which consists of one Eclipse Java project.

This is an example of plugin with no application-specific GUI.  This
plugin is purely dialogue based and is implemented using D4g (see
docs/RichSidnerNooraeiCoon2012.pdf).

To run the server side of this plugin by itself, use the main class of
edu.wpi.always.weather.WeatherPlugin.

[As of 1/3/12, this plugin runs, but is under development.]
