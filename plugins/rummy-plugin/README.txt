This folder contains the implementation of the plugin for playing
rummy, which consists of one Eclipse Java project (rummy), two Visual
Studio C# projects (Rummy.Game and Rummy.UI), and some projects for
testing.

This is an example of plugin with an application-specific GUI
(Rummy.UI projec) and most of the logic on the *client* side
(Rummy.Game project).

To run the server side of this plugin by itself, use the main class of
edu.wpi.always.rummy.RummyPlugin.

To run the client side of this plugin, use the Rummy solution with
startup project Rummy.Startup.

[As of 1/3/12, this plugin runs but is under development]
