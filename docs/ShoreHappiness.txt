If you ever wanted to add happiness detection to the Face Detection
system of always-on, do the following:

1. Open the VS solution in this folder (core/FaceDetection) and add these lines to the FaceDetection.CPP file:

faceInfo.intHappiness = recognizeHappiness(content->GetObject(intSelectedFaceIndex)); // inside the getAgentFaceInfo() // where other faceInfo fields are filled. (around line 250).

2. Set the flag analyzeHappy to true for the agent (line 138)

3. Add the following method:

int recognizeHappiness( Shore::Object const* object )
{
return *(object->GetRating(0)); //0 Rating index is for Happy
}

4. Now build the project and the resulting dll file inside x64 folder should be copied to the \core\agent\lib\win32-x86-64 folder.

5. Now your dll will send the faceInfo with a Happiness value. Inside the following Java files make the obvious changes for reading the value such as other fields of faceInfo.

FacePerception.Java
FakeFacePerception.Java
ShoreFacePerceptor.Java
