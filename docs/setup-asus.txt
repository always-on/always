Restoring the webcam:

For no apparent reason today, Windows could not find the builtin
webcam on my ASUS.  After some web searching I found the diagosis and
solution.  For some reason, the camera got disabled in the BIOS!

To fix it, reboot the machine and when the ASUS splash screen comes
up, press F2 to get into the BIOS.  Then under "devices", you will see
the camera and it will say "Disabled" next it.  Click the button to
enable it.  Exit from BIOS, saving settings, and let the restart
finish.
