#
# Runs the given script file using Always.Disco and compares resulting temporary
# log with corresponding test log file <filename>.test, if it exists
# 
# Note that cp's are relative to location of _run below!
#
# NB: Unlike always-disco, this command does *not* call always-restore-user
#     to restore always/user/TestUser.owl to its original value.
